1,"This product was poorly made and didn't fit tightly enough to actually strain anything - everything just poured out no matter how I tried to use it. I returned it immediately. However, what bothers me the most about this product is the constant barrage of emails from the seller, asking me for reviews. I initially wasn't going to leave a bad review, and just quietly return the faulty product. But they just kept messaging me over and over again even after I asked them to stop.So here it is: The strainer doesn't work and the seller is annoying and harasses the customer. Maybe now they'll stop sending me emails.",Fear
2,Beware only four large kids are vented!!! Pictures and descriptions are not accurate with regards to all size lids being vented. These take forever to dry whether washed by hands or in dishwasher. I would have passed on this set if I had known all the lids were not vented. This is deceptive advertising and amazon needs to rectify the picture showing all size lids are vented as well as the description. Other reviewers have noted similar misleading info on which lids are vented.,Angry
3,Picture is deceiving. Biggest container is much smaller that it looks. Disappointing. I’ll be returning these. Need big containers as well as small ones. This won’t do.,Angry
4,Lovely product,Happy
5,"I have terrible arthritis in my hands. I love Kitchenaid! I show a picture of my fingers, why I need a scissors with bigger openings for my fingers. A great product for arthritic hands and great quality. Highly recommend!",Happy
6,"I've had great experiences with KitchenAid products in the past, but I was really disappointed with the workmanship of these scissors. The blades stayed pretty sharp for the most part, BUT the screw that holds the blades together came loose within the first 6 months I had them! I first re-tightened the screw by hand, thinking it was just a fluke or something, but every. single. time. I use them to cut something (meat, salad greens, you name it), the screw comes loose. We tried tightening the screw with tools the next few times, but it will not stay tight. (This is particularly bad because the blades need to be flush against each other to cut effectively -- when the screw gets loosed, the blades are wiggly and cut like that bad pair of scissors that can't cut straight...). I'm super disappointed :(",Sad
7,"""dishwasher safe""... er... no... rusted after 1 wash... literally rust spots everywhere. They are sharp but the fact they rusted the same day I opened the package is unforgivable. Returning!!!",Fear
8,I had to return them immediately cause the size of the boxes were too small - they shoulhd have given a size idea in the product details.,Fear
9,"I love these cups, the lids snap on so quickly and securely with one hand! I made jello shots with them & they're perfect to stack ontop of each other to set in the fridge - saves a ton of space. I was worried about the mess / hassle (that I made with different cups & I had 2 helpers), this time - it was only me. And, it was so much easier (even though I didn't have any help - I was shocked)! I will buy these again and recommend everyone does as well.",Happy
10,I'm so happy that I got these. Seller communicates quickly when asked a question about it. Yes they are freezable. This product will help me with my portion sizes after my gastric bypass surgery.,Happy
11,"These cups were perfect. They are thicker than I expected and seem to thicker than the 2oz size. In attempt to respect the public health recommendations for serving food products during COVID, I used the cups to provide individual portions of mustard and butter (the 2oz size).",Happy
12,"It is ok to mopping floor, it is cheap and it looks cheap too. The mopping head is smaller than what I thought, the handle is thin and light. In short won’t buy this mopping kit again. You can add a bit more money to get a better product I believe",Angry
13,Fácil de usar y de cambiar los repuestos,Happy
14,"I ordered one and it was defective. Got the replacement and it was defective, also. After going to all the trouble of unpacking and setting both of these up and finding that neither works, I am not a happy person. Will never order anything like this from Amazon again. I should have bought it at Walmart.",Sad

16,Perfect for my son to use to reach the sink when brushing his teeth and wash his hands. He is 18 months.,Happy
17,"Unfortunately you cannot separate these towels. The preforation is very light and since it’s post consumer paper, it’s pretty flimsy. I’ve never been able to grab a full square it just shreds in your hand. Even he try to hold it I’ve never been able to tear it at the preforation and I pulled like 30 of these so far. Just my observation.",Sad
18,"I had forgotten how bad these paper towels are. The sheets don't rip cleanly, and I find myself using 3-4 of these paper towels to do the job of one section of the ""choose a size"" paper towels by Brawny, Bounty or even Great Value brand. Skip them, you're doing no favors for the environment because you have to use so many of them. And...they leave LINT on everything you wipe down with them. Hard pass.",Angry
19,"Great mixer, I used to have the same one but had to get rid of it because of moving. Very simple and powerful, doesn’t take space in my kitchen.",Happy
20,Don't use this for extreme temperatures as it will shatter. People have been severely injured by using this. Pyrex has destroyed their brand by using the same name for their lab grade borosilicate and this normal glassware.,Angry
21,"Bought these about nine months ago. Have washed them in the dishwasher once or twice a week since then. Kept them in a cupboard. The markings have washed off the one- and two-cup measures, so they're now useless. These cups are not dishwasher-safe, though they're advertised as such.",Angry
22,"Nothing beats a classic pyrex measuring cup for cooking and baking. I love that this has both metric and imperial measurements, so I can use recipes from all over the world.",Happy
23,"These jugs are a disappointment. The glass itself is good quality and while dishwasher safe, I have noticed some of the lettering on the side is starting fade. The pouring spouts are useless and when pouring water and stocks etc more water ends up on the kitchen bench than anywhere else. There is no point to buying them, they aren't good for pouring and the measurement markers wear.",Angry
24,"I was so excited to get this set, especially for the larger size cups. And with the name Pyrex, you would assume quality. However, they drip when pouring to a ridiculous amount. The 4-cup measure in particular is utterly unusable for pouring liquids. I tried many times over... adapting pouring speed, angle, etc. I always ended up with water all over the counter. This is completely useless. It will only be good for measuring quantities of solid items, like chopped vegetables. As liquid measures, these are terrible. I'm stunned and disappointed.",Angry
25,"Lodge cast iron pans are the best. My only regret is that I bought it for a man who didn't deserve it. The good thing? It'll last forever, so unless he throws it out or gives it away he'll have a life-long reminder of what he lost!",Happy
26,I had no idea how far out my oven was reading. Perfect cakes and better cooked pizzas now. Happy days.,Happy
27,"This thermometer is not accurate at all. Constantly 100 degrees off temperature. Even if it were accurate, the base is not wide enough to sit on the racks (falls through) and the face is too small to read without opening the oven to look at it which defeats the whole purpose of heating your oven precisely. Lastly, it is way over-priced. Disappointed for a brand name product such as Rubermaid.",Angry
28,This can opener is so smooth to use and looks very good.,Happy
29,Very well made product. Very sturdy and a delight to use.,Happy
30,"This can opener is just like my old one that needed to be replaced that is why i bought it. I would send it back but is not worth the hassle of boxing it up etc. It starts opening your can fine for about 2 or 3 turns and then turns sideways and then you have to try to start where it left off because it wont open any further. I am very diappointed, i really liked the color and my opener is about 40 years old, imagine and still works but not as well. Good thing i didnt throw it out",Angry
31,Buyers beware. I ordered the part number for my Frigidaire WF3CB which is on my current filter in use now. When these arrived I did not physically check the contents of the boxes since the part numbers were the same of what was currently in my Frigidaire. Well when I came time to change the filter out low and behold the ones I purchased were not close to fitting. They are much shorter and have an extra rib on the side. Photos if needed.,Angry
32,This is a counterfeit product. The trademark on the Frigidaire and the puresource logo is just a DOT. Not the the encircled R used on any registered product in the US. The canister was also almost weightless compared to the original filter that came with my refrigerator. The packaging had the top ripped off and one of the protective plastic covers for the prongs was broken. I am reporting this to US Customs as well as Amazon. The only reason it has one star in rating is because I could not submit this without choosing a star. I would rate it illegal.,Angry
33,"This pot is designed to not work. The surface area of the pressure indicating valve is too small for the weight of the valve to be lifted by steam pressure. Result? The valve stays open and the pot simply boils away the liquid inside and does not build pressure. The ""solution"" is to use an implement of some sort to manually pull the indicating valve up into a sealed position once the pot starts to make steam. If this is not done, the valve will not lift and seal and water will simply boil away. It is important to note that this is not due to a dirty valve, a sticky valve, insufficient liquid or any malfunction. Rather, it is designed into the pot. Ours will be relegated to stock pot duty as we have found it to be totally unusable as a pressure cooker.",Angry
34,"Bought this more expensive, seemingly better filter, and upon testing the water the quality was worse than the cheap ones. What a waste. What a lie.",Angry
35,"DO NOT BUY!!! After three months of TOTAL FRUSTRATION back and forth with customer service, several replacement filters ALL DEFECTIVE!!! Filters make the water taste AWFUL much worse than Chlorine. I have used this product for years, now Something is seriously wrong with the filters in a packet of three, maybe if you are lucky, one works!! Someone in this company is making very bad productivity decisions. I will never purchase again. Seriously!!!!!!",Angry
36,"These don't look like the Pur filters I buy at the store. They didn't come in a box. They did not have the Pur decal on the exterior cover or on the filter, as shown in the picture. Filtering my water properly is very important to me so I am not going to use these, because I don't know how they were made and with what they filter. I noticed some of the reviews reported that the filters would get stuck and you would have to pound them on something. I have used Pur filters from a local store, and that has never happened to me before.",Angry
37,"These are not originals!!! they come with a gold seal wrapper . The first one I opened left sediment around the upper chamber, the second one barely could perform filtration it just sort of leaked into the pitcher I was considering having the filter tested on the third one that I have not opened yet. It is so very disappointing when you find a product you like then the next time you purchase same it is not the same quality",Angry
38,"After a few weeks of using this filter the flow slowed considerably and is now nearly at a standstill. Have tried drying it out and shaking it as some suggest online, but it hasn't helped at all.",Sad
39,"I received the product as scheduled. After using it once, it stopped working. I had to return it. What a waste of time!",Angry

41,Good sharp scissors to replace old ones. Grip is nice and soft. Blades are sharp. They’re scissors so I don’t ask a lot from them. Probably get a cheaper set in the supermarkets but these should last a while. Nice plastic blade cover for when in the kitchen drawers.,Happy
42,"Good quality scissors also a great grip lovely for cutting, very pleased",Happy

46,"Great clips, I read a few complaints about the magnet. The funny thing is the clip is being used to clamp bags that can't be closed because there aren't seals on them. The clips are not for putting on your fridge for decorations - lol... I really like them and the ones I haven't used yet I put on my fridge for easy access for when I do need it.... The magnet is fine!",Happy
47,Oh my gosh. I never thought I’d have such intense feelings for a lemon zester. This thing is AMAZING. don’t bother looking at the other zesters just get this one. It’s so nice that it has a sheath to cover it. And oh my gosh this thing works so well. It showed that lemon who’s boss. I’m not even kidding. I zested a lemon with a regular small holed cheese grater yesterday before this came and then today I used this one and the zest from the regular cheese grader was like 2 table spoons but with this zester it was like at least a cup. It’s so easy to use and the handle has a nice grip to it. Not to heavy or too light. Never thought I’d be so passionate about a kitchen tool.,Happy
48,"I liked the grater because it is very easy to use, very sharp and easy to clean",Happy
49,"Terrible wine opener. I have tried using this opener twice and it only pulls the cork out half way and I have to use a manual opener to get the cork out. Unfortunately, I'm now told that I can't return the item. Don't buy this. I'll stick with the old fashioned manual opener and save myself the trouble.",Angry
50,"Simply the best. This is what you need. I have made cups of tea, coffee etc 24hrs after filling this 1.9l flask! It was still hot enough to make hot drinks with. Great quality. No glass inner bottle to smash at the first knock. Love it. This is my second one and I use them both regularly for expeditions and client tea breaks.",Happy
51,"I was perfectly content with my generic vegetable peeler. It did a decent job. Then I tried the Spring Chef Premium Swivel Vegetable Peeler at my daughter's house over Thanksgiving. Where has this little peeler been all my life? It made peeling potatoes effortless! Super comfortable, lightweight, glides over vegetables - plus an unbelievably reasonable price. I'm buying one for my sister, and highly recommend it to anyone. Even if you're happy with your current peeler, just try this one - you won't regret it.",Happy
52,"Best peeler ever! Nice, big and solid handle to hold. I love that it swivels. I had a very old swivel peeler that I finally needed to replace and got a stationary peeler. They take off big chunks of food with the peel and not easy to use on odd shaped foods. As you can see, this one only takes a thin layer, and when working with very small foods like kiwis, that's a pretty important feature.",Happy
53,Very sharp and made light work of carrot peeling. Also did well with apples. Maybe it would be slightly better if the peeler had some curvature in the blade. It would also be good if the end had a little tool to pick out eyes in potatoes like my last peeler had. Apart from that I'm happy wit it.,Happy
54,"This really is the best peeler that I have bought and there have been many over the years. Great quality, very comfortable in the hand and it works really well. The final test for me was when I peeled celery, it took a fine skin off and without messy stringy bits clogging up the peeler.",Happy
55,Peeler arrived within two days of order and works a treat. Very similar to my old one which was an antique (30+ yrs). If this one lasts the same well worth the money would recommend to Friends & Family. Very happy excellent value just perfect.,Happy
56,"I use it for sweet potatoes and carrots because resting them on the cutting board, I move the peeler very fast into two directions.",
57,"Very sharp, fits comfortably in hand, easy to use. Made me realise how dull my previous one was (over a decade old). Probably ought to replace these more often. Will buy again.",Happy
58,"Love this scale. It is replacing an older unit that is very similar. However, this thing has a few minor feature differences that are adding up to a much nicer user experience. First, i like the back-lit display. My doesn't have this and often if i had a large pot or bottle or something like that on the scale, the shadow caused by larger vessels would sometimes make the readout hard to see. Second, my old unit uses a big watch style battery, this one uses ubiquitous AAA batteries. Much more convenient to replace when needed. Thirdly and most importantly my old scale only went up to 11 lbs, this thing doubles that. So if i'm making a large quantity of something, i no longer have to measure out half of it in one vessel, half in another, then combine them. I can mix everything in one vessel if i want.",Happy
59,I am into fitness and diet from past few weeks and brought this food scale to follow my fitness goals I kind of tested it if its reliable or not and it looks like it gives accurate results. will recommend this product.,Happy
60,"I should have purchased a long time ago. Measuring ingredients (especially in grams) is so much easier than Imperial measures of volume. Nowadays many more recipes use grams, and my experience is being able to accurately measure 50 grams is absolutely needed to feed sourdough starter. The tare weight function works really well, too. It must be used on a solid flat surface, which does not include a tiled countertop. My old canning scale was non-metric and non-digital, and I will never go back after using this scale.",Happy
61,It’s a good kitchen weigh scale. But if you are using it for workout etc; maybe you might wanna consider something that can also display calories etc. but it’s good to start and does the purpose.,Happy
62,Not accurate at all.,Fear
63,"This dish rack is very attractive and super functional, but has one HUGE problem. The mat is not as wide as the rack! I've had to choose which side I prefer the water to leak onto the counter...or just not use that side of the rack. Not the quality I expect from Kitchen-Aid!",Sad
64,"I was very excited about my new dish drying rack, loved the design. But after using little over week started seeing rust. Very Disappointed not worth spending money returning.",Sad
65,Badly constructed. The rack does not sit in the tray completely so water drips all over the countertop. The quality of the product does not justify the price of $50.,Angry
66,It’s not large ..I was expecting a nice size and it’s not stable the bottom part made from cheap plastic.i don’t recommend this item,Sad
67,"Like the size of this dish rack. However, same as previous purchased, rust after one month, and started to show..",Sad
68,"We decided to go dishwasher-less in our new place, and this dish rack has been a lifesaver. It's sturdy, and we always find that there's enough room for our after-meal dishes. Plus, it's a little more stylish than other dish racks I've seen.",Happy
69,"I bought this crock pot to replace a Hamilton slow cooker that I had for almost 10 years. I just wanted something stainless steel that looked nicer, but I wish I would have just kept my Hamilton slow cooker that actually worked. The ""keep warm"" function is actually hotter than the ""low"" function, and could even be hotter than the high temperature. It's waaay off. The low function also cooks way too hot, a 4lb pot roast cooked on ""low"" in less than 4 hours, when it should have been 6-8. The edges were burned black and it was completely dried out. I thought crock pot would be a reliable brand, turns out I was wrong.",Happy
70,I loved my old crockpot so I was very surprised to get this and hate it. I read the reviews of the pot runnin too hot but I’m having the exact opposite problem- this does not get my food done. I’ve always been able to put a roast in the crockpot and have it done in 8 hours. I e tried 5 different roasts in this one at least and none of them are getting done- even at 10 hours on low. Today I put one in on high since I’m home all day and 5 hours in and it’s not even close to being tender. So disappointing.,Angry
71,I broke the lid. I tried to order another lid. Crock Pot company said it was not available at this time. I read a review that said that a replacement lid was still not available after two years. So to all who want to buy this product...you may wish to take my experience into consideration prior to your purchase.,Sad
72,This was a Christmas gift for my wife. She has used it less than five times since then. Today she goes to lock the lid and the clamp snapped off the lid. Poor constructions of this product. The clamps feel very cheap and are only held on by a pin and clip. This is very disappointing that a name brand product that is not cheap broke so easily and soon after purchase. If I could give it 0 stars I would.,Angry
73,The crock heats fine - but high and low are the same temp and when I try to change any settings once the unit is running the control panel freezes and I have to go to great lengths (reset process) to get it to work.,Sad
74,"It works well, slower than other croc pot that I had in cooking when a lot in it. Takes much longer even at high. The rubber around the lid is very flimsy, had to replace the lid once as it ripped very easily. Overall it is a good size (almost too big) but can put a small roast in it with veggies to cook but it will take an entire day (even at high) to do it. Said it came with recipes - there were 5 or 6 on a sheet of paper with the instructions for use. Misleading in that",Sad
75,"uni student and I bought it because I thought it would make life easier. it did a lot !! its so easy to use, I just YouTube everything I wanted to cook, and its mad easy to clean, only down side Is that the cord to plug it in is very short, and its not really mobile. never the less I love it man, use I every week to make chicken.",Happy
76,I have used several times with success. I like the way it shuts off & automatically goes to warm. I am REALLY happy with this slow cooker & more than glad I decided to buy,Happy
77,CAUTION - this item (per Shark) is NOT able to blend HOT or FROZEN ingredients. When making coffee - the top would explode right off the base. I purchased it 2/3 and decided to call the manufacturer. He told me they can't help to go thru Amazon and wouldn't you know... time to return is OVER! Boo.... be careful. Don't buy if you are planning to use for frozen or hot liquids!,Fear
78,Very disappointed and wary about this product. Each time I blend w smoothie or juice always this funny smell and black dust comes out of the machine...,Fear
79,This little guy shouldn't be underestimated. It blends my dates. Even my big Black and Decker can't blend it. Some reviewers complain it's too noisy. You're paying how much? It's not the price of a vitamix. So don't expect every bell and whistle for the price you are paying for. It does its blend well... It's a convenient one serving size ready to go and space saving. That's it. Appreciate it for what it is.,Happy
80,I bought this product solely for protein shakes and smoothies. It is by far the best item I have purchased. I like to have ice in my smoothies and the ninja crushes it to perfection. Very happy with my ninja!,Happy
81,"We love this airfryer. Obviously with all of these fryers you are supposed to use liners, that keeps the non stick from peeling off. I wouldn't take a review from anyone who doesn't follow simple directions and use liners seriously. Use liners, rinse out after every use, do not scrub, and it will last forever.",Happy
82,"The cooking results have been great. But the first 2 times we used it, we heard a loud pop and discovered a hairline crack in our quartz kitchen countertops. We now use it on top of a large wood butcher block cutting board. No issues since. Banana bread, chicken thighs, fish & French fries have all been amazing!",Fear
83,"It works as is supposed to, although after a few uses the black surface started chipping. Everything i cook, i only get half of it, the other half just stays on the tray and i cannot remove. Very dissapointed",Sad

85,"This product is dAngryous. The bottom tray will detach and fall to the floor after a few uses (6 in my case). My daughter wanted to run and help pick it up, it would have seriously burned her. It burned my carpet and dumped its contents all over. Do NOT buy!!",Fear
86,"I had been looking for another method of baking, cooking healthy for myself and family. Its been a very hot and humid summer. The AIr Fryer is a nice addition to our kitchen we chose classic black, its sturdy, easy to use, includes manual with tips - we recommend everyone follows their tips before tweaking them, since they are the makers, their way is the best in my humble opinion. Manual includes recipes, easy to follow steps, you can also now go on line to find more recipes if you like. Overall, we love that you really do not have to use any oil! Really its true, this model has improved over time, and they continue to; its a great time to invest in this model as it will pay for itself quickly.

88,I love this can opener! I have terrible arthritis and have tried many other openers. This one is amazingly easy to operate. Once you place the can just lower the lever and the can opens by itself. The price is very reasonable. I would suggest to the company to advertise for people with arthritis because it sure makes my life a whole lot easier! Light weight and easy to clean as well.,Happy
89,This worked a very few times and then quit. The included 3-year warranty requires me to securely ship it to AZ and include another $10 for them to ship it back when repaired -- a total more than the $20 price of the new product. Definitely a strike against Cuisinart in my estimation.,Sad
90,"This appliance is not constructed with the high quality that has been the Hallmark of Cuisinart appliances for many years. This current product is manufactured off shore,(China) and lacks the durability and acceptable level of quality",Sad
91,I choose this can opener due to the brand name Cuisinart. It has simple styling and cleans easily. I like the fact that I can open large cans or tall cans. Many openers out there are too short for this and only open small cans. This has worked perfect.,Happy
92,"I am visually impaired and was struck by tennis elbow. Opening cans to make dinner was painful and awkward.

Just wanted to warn anyone who was thinking about purchasing this.,Angry
96,"I bought this grinder because it was supposed to be easy to clean and dishwasher safe.
